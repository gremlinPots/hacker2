ABOUT THIS REMAKE

All entries must include a readme.txt explaining everything there is to know about the game. What is it a remake of, what do you have to do, what are the controls, any details about the authors, that sort of thing.

Like it's predecessor 'Hacker', 'Hacker 2' 

'Hacker 2' is not a game you can jump quickly into.

I've also included the original manual (see the 'MSFM Operational Aspects' textfile), which is as relevent to the remake as it was to the original. I recommend you read it.
