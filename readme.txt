Another unfinished project now uploaded to git for anyone to mess with.

The game is more or less playable and completable: graphics remain unfinished. As a Blitz3D game, I’m not sure if it would run at all in modern versions of Windows, and I’m unable to test this in any way.

Gameplay mechanics were meticulously backward-engineered: guard timings and routes are identical to the original game.

I've included the original manual (see the 'MSFM Operational Aspects' textfile), which is as relevant to the remake as it was to the original.
